this is a demo for class


A readme typically includes an overview about what the project is and supposed to do, how to make it do that, and any weird things the user should know throughout the process.

In an information package for the purposes of this class would also include all that, with the addition of stating what a piece looked like when you originally encountered it, and what interventions you took to either preserve or alter it so that it is what a user will encounter when looking at these files. This can also be done in a changelog (a separate file), if you are expecting many people to look at and work with a package. 

Github automatically publishes interventions (changelogs) in the form of commits.

An information package can (and probably should) include metadata tags, but we'll get to that towards the end of the semester. This is usually in an XML file, but, kind of confusing so let's table that. 

You will not have to use Github for this class, but I thought just getting everyone familiar with its existence was prudent
