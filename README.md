This is a program to hack your computer.

Download the enclosed python file (button.py) and move it to your desktop.
---


WINDOWS:
-------

You should be able to just double click the file and it will open. IF NOT (which I just learned it might not)

Search the Start menu for Command Prompt.

type "cd  \YOUR USERNAME\Desktop" with NO QUOTES, where [YOUR USERNAME] is your user name that you log in with and hit enter *THIS MIGHT NOT BE CORRECT*

type "python button.py" and hit enter.



MAC:
----

Open the TERMINAL app (Applications > utilities > Terminal)

type "cd /Users/YOUR USERNAME/Desktop/" with NO QUOTES, where [YOUR USERNAME] is your user name (that you log in with) and hit enter

type "python3 button.py" and hit enter



You have just been hacked.
